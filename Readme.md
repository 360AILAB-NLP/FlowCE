This is the official repository for paper:First Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of Flowchart Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10057) 


## FlowCE Benchmark Datast

FlowCE is built upon 500 real-world flowcharts, ensuring an ample diversity in each chart and across five dimen-sions in real flowchart scenarios, including reasoning, infor- mation extraction, localization recognition, summarization, and logical verification

we only published the flowchart image source links, which 


## one more thing..

The evaluation code will be published soon..
