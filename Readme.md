This is the official repository for paper:First Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of Flowchart Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10057) 


## FlowCE Benchmark Datast

FlowCE is built upon 500 real-world flowcharts, ensuring an ample diversity in each chart and across five dimen-sions in real flowchart scenarios, including reasoning, infor- mation extraction, localization recognition, summarization, and logical verification

The image data used in this work is solely for scientific research purposes, and only the source link address for each image is made available. It can be obtained from the following address: https://github.com/360AILAB-NLP/FlowCE/tree/main/flowce_benchmark

## one more thing..

The evaluation code will be published soon..
